    # AWS IoT Policy Attachment Resource
    # 
    # Attaches IoT policies to certificates or other principals, defining the permissions
    # and access controls for IoT devices. This is critical for implementing security
    # in IoT deployments by controlling what actions devices can perform.
    #
    # @example Attach policy to certificate
    #   aws_iot_policy_attachment(:device_permissions, {
    #     policy: "DeviceBasicPolicy",
    #     target: "arn:aws:iot:us-east-1:123456789012:cert/abcd1234"
    #   })
    #
    # @example Using policy and certificate references
    #   device_policy = aws_iot_policy(:device_policy, {
    #     name: "DeviceOperationsPolicy",
    #     policy: policy_document
    #   })
    #   
    #   device_cert = aws_iot_certificate(:device_cert, {
    #     active: true
    #   })
    #   
    #   aws_iot_policy_attachment(:secure_device, {
    #     policy: device_policy.name,
    #     target: device_cert.arn
    #   })
    #
    # @example Multiple policies per certificate
    #   # Basic connectivity policy
    #   aws_iot_policy_attachment(:basic_connectivity, {
    #     policy: "BasicConnectivityPolicy",
    #     target: certificate_arn
    #   })
    #   
    #   # Application-specific policy
    #   aws_iot_policy_attachment(:app_permissions, {
    #     policy: "SensorDataPolicy",
    #     target: certificate_arn
    #   })
    #
    # @example Policy attached to thing group
    #   aws_iot_policy_attachment(:group_policy, {
    #     policy: "ProductionDevicesPolicy",
    #     target: "arn:aws:iot:us-east-1:123456789012:thinggroup/production-sensors"
