    # AWS IoT Thing Principal Attachment Resource
    # 
    # Attaches X.509 certificates or other principals to IoT things, enabling secure device
    # authentication and authorization. This is a crucial component of the IoT security model,
    # allowing devices to authenticate using certificates and access AWS IoT services.
    #
    # @example Attach certificate to thing
    #   aws_iot_thing_principal_attachment(:device_cert, {
    #     thing_name: "sensor-001",
    #     principal: "arn:aws:iot:us-east-1:123456789012:cert/abcd1234"
    #   })
    #
    # @example Using certificate reference
    #   cert = aws_iot_certificate(:device_certificate, {
    #     active: true

    #   thing = aws_iot_thing(:temperature_sensor, {

    #     thing_name: thing.thing_name,
